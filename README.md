This project involves predicting dissolved oxygen levels using a hybrid approach combining CEEMDAN for signal decomposition, VMD for mode decomposition, and a BiLSTM neural network with an attention mechanism.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

1. numpy
2. pandas
3. tensorflow
4. keras
5. scikit-learn
6. vmdpy
7. PyEMD

Notes
1. Adjust the file path and column names as per your dataset.
2. Modify the hyperparameters for better performance based on your dataset and requirements.

The dataset for the other stations are also attached:

1. UP08: Narora
2. UP09: Kachla Ghat, Badaun
UP14: Ghatiya ghat, Farrukhabad
UP18: Bridge at Bithoor
UP19: Ganga Barrage, Kanpur
UP24: Bathing Ghat, Kanpur
UP26: Shuklaganj, Kanpur
UP32: Ansi, Fatehpur
UP55: Gomti, Varanasi
UP56: Rajwari

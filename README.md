This project involves predicting dissolved oxygen levels using a hybrid approach combining CEEMDAN for signal decomposition, VMD for mode decomposition, and a BiLSTM neural network with an attention mechanism.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

1. numpy
2. pandas
3. tensorflow
4. keras
5. scikit-learn
6. vmdpy
7. PyEMD

Notes
1. Adjust the file path and column names as per your dataset.
2. Modify the hyperparameters for better performance based on your dataset and requirements.
